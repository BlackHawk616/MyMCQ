      <h4>Question 01:</h4>
      <h4>Extract</h4>
      <p> “Mr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next lesson, he
        assigned me a second essay. This time it was supposed to be on ‘An Incorrigible Chatterbox’. I handed it in, and
        Mr Keesing had nothing to complain about for two whole lessons. However, during the third lesson, he’d finally
        had enough. “Anne Frank, as a punishment for talking in class, wrote an essay entitled-‘Quack, Quack, Quack,
        said Mistress Chatterbox’.”</p>
      <h6>(I) What convincing argument was made by Anne? </h6>
      <ul>
        <li>a. She found it impossible to be quiet like the others as she couldn’t change herself.</li>
        <li>b. She had inherited the trait from her mother, so she couldn’t stop being talkative.</li>
        <li>c. She had the right to be talkative, as it was a classroom and not a prison.</li>
